### Recovery Demonstrations

*Does this dataset include examples of recovering from failure?*

- [ ] **Yes**
- [ ] **No**

**If yes, please briefly describe the recovery process:**

*Example: For 250 demonstrations, demonstrations are initialized from a failed needle grasp position, the operator re-orients the robotic grippers and attempts to grasp the needle again from a different angle.*

## 💡 Diversity Dimensions

*Check all dimensions that were intentionally varied during data collection.*

- [ ] **Camera Position / Angle**
- [ ] **Lighting Conditions**
- [ ] **Target Object** (e.g., different phantom models, suture types)
- [ ] **Spatial Layout** (e.g., placing the target suture needle in various locations)
- [ ] **Robot Embodiment** (if multiple robots were used)
- [ ] **Task Execution** (e.g., different techniques for the same task)
- [ ] **Background / Scene**
- [ ] **Other** (Please specify: `[Your Dimension]`)

*If you checked any of the above please briefly elaborate below.*

**Example:** We adjusted the room camera perspective every 100 demonstrations. The camera angle was varied by panning up and down by +/- 10 degrees, as well as manually adjusting the height of the camera mount by +/- 2 cm. Additionally, we varied the needle used by swapping out various curvatures, including 1/4, 3/8, 1/2, and 5/8.

## 🎯 Action & State Space Representation

*Describe how actions and robot states are represented in your dataset. This is crucial for understanding data compatibility and enabling effective policy learning.*

### Action Space Representation

*Note: the shipped `action` / `observation.state` must follow the Standardized Representations below (absolute Cartesian end-effector pose with quaternions). Use these checklists to describe any additional or source-native representations included in the dataset.*

**Primary Action Representation:**
- [ ] **Absolute Cartesian** (position/orientation relative to robot base)
- [ ] **Relative Cartesian** (delta position/orientation from current pose)
- [ ] **Joint Space** (direct joint angle commands)
- [ ] **Other** (Please specify: `[Your Representation]`)

**Orientation Representation:**
- [ ] **Quaternions** (x, y, z, w)
- [ ] **Euler Angles** (roll, pitch, yaw)
- [ ] **Axis-Angle** (rotation vector)
- [ ] **Rotation Matrix** (3x3 matrix)
- [ ] **Other** (Please specify: `[Your Representation]`)

**Reference Frame:**
- [ ] **Robot Base Frame**
- [ ] **Tool/End-Effector Frame**
- [ ] **World/Global Frame**
- [ ] **Camera Frame**
- [ ] **Other** (Please specify: `[Your Frame]`)

**Action Dimensions:**
*List the action space dimensions and their meanings.*

**Example:**
```
action: [x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw, gripper]
- x, y, z: Absolute position in robot base frame (meters)
- qx, qy, qz, qw: Absolute orientation as quaternion
- gripper: Gripper opening angle (radians)
```

### State Space Representation

**State Information Included:**
- [ ] **Joint Positions** (all articulated joints)
- [ ] **Joint Velocities**
- [ ] **End-Effector Pose** (Cartesian position/orientation)
- [ ] **Force/Torque Readings**
- [ ] **Gripper State** (position, force, etc.)
- [ ] **Other** (Please specify: `[Your State Info]`)

**State Dimensions:**
*List the state space dimensions and their meanings.*

**Example:**
```
observation.state: [x_m, y_m, z_m, qx, qy, qz, qw, gripper]
- x_m, y_m, z_m: Measured end-effector position in the robot base frame (meters)
- qx, qy, qz, qw: Measured end-effector orientation as a quaternion
- gripper: Current gripper opening

observation.meta.joint_positions: [j1, j2, j3, j4, j5, j6, j7]
- j1-j7: Absolute joint positions for a 7-DOF arm (radians), auxiliary
```

### 📋 Standardized Representations

*Open-H-Embodiment v2 standardizes on absolute Cartesian end-effector kinematics as the primary content of `action` and `observation.state`:*

**Primary Action & State Layout:**
- **`action` / `observation.state`**: Absolute Cartesian end-effector pose with absolute quaternions
  ```
  [x_m, y_m, z_m, qx, qy, qz, qw, gripper]
  ```
  Multi-arm platforms (e.g., dVRK PSM1 + PSM2) concatenate one block per arm.

**Recommended Auxiliary Fields:**
- **`observation.meta.joint_positions`**: Absolute positions for all articulated joints
  ```
  [joint_1, joint_2, ..., joint_n]
  ```

## ⏱️ Data Synchronization Approach

*Describe how you achieved proper data synchronization across different sensors, cameras, and robotic systems during data collection. This is crucial for ensuring temporal alignment of all modalities in your dataset.*

**Example:** *We collect joint kinematics from our Franka Research 3 and RGB-D frames from Intel RealSense D435 cameras, all running in ROS 2 Galactic on the same workstation clocked with ROS Time. Both drivers stamp their outgoing messages’ header.stamp fields with the shared system clock, and we record /joint_states, /camera/*/image_raw, and /camera/*/camera_info in a single rosbag2 session. During export to LeRobot, each data point’s ROS header.stamp is written verbatim into the `observation.meta.host_stamp_ns` feature (`int64`, Unix-epoch nanoseconds). Offline checks show inter-sensor skew stays below ±2 ms across a 2-minute capture.*
